# CLAUDE.md

Team instructions for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Akash Mannil's personal portfolio** — a single-page React app organised as tabs (Home / About / Experience / Skills / Work / Contact), each tab a full page with its own 3D Three.js scene, with GSAP transitions between tabs. All visible content (text, images, experience, skills) is managed through [src/constants/index.js](src/constants/index.js). The Work tab additionally pulls the latest public repos live from the GitHub API.

## Stack at a Glance

- **React 19** + **Vite 7** — no class components, use functional components only
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — utility-first; custom tokens defined in `src/index.css` under `@theme`
- **Three.js / @react-three/fiber** — 3D rendering; all Canvas components live in `src/components/three/` (a single fixed `ScrollStage` canvas morphs between one scene per tab; the active tab's pose lives in `stagePose.js` → `tabPoses`)
- **GSAP 3** — animations use `useGSAP` hook (not `useEffect`); tab page transitions are driven by `src/components/TabView.jsx`; no ScrollTrigger/Lenis — the app is tab-based, not scroll-based
- **EmailJS** — contact form; credentials are Vite env vars (`VITE_APP_EMAILJS_*`)

## Coding Standards

See `.claude/rules/` for detailed rules. Short version:

- No `import React from 'react'` — JSX transform is enabled
- No unnecessary comments; name things clearly instead
- Prefer editing `src/constants/index.js` for content changes over touching component files
- Keep components under 100 lines where possible; split into smaller pieces if larger
- All 3D scenes need a `<Suspense>` boundary with a fallback

## Common Tasks

| Task | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Change tabs / nav | `src/constants/index.js` → `tabs` (rendered by `NavBar`, pages mapped in `TabView.jsx`) |
| Tune the GitHub repo feed (Work tab) | `src/constants/index.js` → `github` (username, excludes, max count; fetched by `src/hooks/useGithubRepos.js`) |
| Add/edit experience | `src/constants/index.js` → `expCards` (rendered by `src/sections/Journey.jsx`; `brand` is the short wordmark printed on the rocket hull) |
| Add a project | `src/constants/index.js` → `projects` + add image to `public/images/` |
| Edit hero / manifesto copy | `src/constants/index.js` → `heroCopy`, `manifesto` |
| Edit skill marquee rows | `src/constants/index.js` → `skillRows` |
| Edit skill solar system (3D skills scene) | `src/constants/index.js` → `skillSystem` (rendered by `TechSphere` / `SkillPlanet`) |
| Change social links | `src/constants/index.js` → `socialImgs` |
| Change theme colours / fonts | `src/index.css` → `@theme` tokens |
| Tune per-tab 3D poses / colours | `src/components/three/stagePose.js` → `tabPoses` |
| Edit a 3D scene (laptop, desk, graph, sphere, cards, rack, terminal) | `src/components/three/` → scene component named in `stageSequence` |

## Dev Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # start dev server (127.0.0.1:5173)
npm run build    # production build → dist/
npm run preview  # preview production build locally
npm run lint     # ESLint check
```

## Environment Variables

Required — create `.env` at project root:

```
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=
```

## What NOT to do

- Do not push `.env` — it contains live EmailJS credentials
- Do not add TypeScript without a deliberate project decision; this repo is plain JS
- Do not install UI component libraries (Shadcn, MUI, etc.) — the design is intentionally custom
- Do not refactor working 3D scenes unless the task specifically requires it — Three.js/R3F setup is fragile to churn
